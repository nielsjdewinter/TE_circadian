# TE_circadian
R scripts to do data processing and produce plots for paper on sub-daily scale fluctuations in trace element composition of mollusk shells

Conents:
- "bandpass_binning_script.R": Script to apply stacking and binning to summarize periodic variability in trace element records.
- "Data_exploration_script.R": Script used to explore raw data, detect outliers and carry out initial data processing.
- "Figure2_script.R": Script to produce Figure 2, plotting all trace element records against distance.
- "Figure3_script.R": Script to produce Figure 3, plotting MTM spectra of pactinid data.
- "Figure4_script.R": Script to produce Figure 4, plotting MTM spectra of pactinid data.
- "Figure5_script.R": Script to produce Figure 5, plotting median and range of amplitude of significant periodicities in trace element records against their period.
- "Figure6_script.R": Script to produce Figure 6, plotting the results of variance decomposition of trace element records.
- "FigX_zoomin_plots.r": Script to create 'zoomed-in' plots of TE variability showing daily and semi-diurnal periodicity in close-up.
- "LOESS smoothing_script.R": Script to apply LOESS smoothing on trace element dataframes.
- "S0_raw_data.r": Script to isolate raw data for supplement files.
- "S5_script.R": Script to produce Figure S5: Plotting length along shell cross sections against shell age (age model figure).
- "S7_Variance decomposition.R": Script to carry out step-by-step variance decomposition of trace element records and plot the results.
- "S8_script.R": Script to produce Figure S8, plotting violin plots to compare trace element variability between specimens and records.
- "S10_script.R": Script to produce Figure S10, plotting stacks of periodic variability to compare between specimens and records.
- "S13_modeled_SrCa3.r": Script to model a virtual Sr/Ca record based on Sano et al. to demonstrate the smoothing effect of our LA-ICP-MS setup.
- "Savitzky-Golay filter_script.R": Script to apply Savitzky-Golay filter on trace element data.
- "Wavelet_script.R: Script to produce wavelets of trace element records (see supplement S9)
